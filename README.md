## LISP Interpreter
I took MIT's Fundamentals of Programming course in Spring 2023. Our last assignment was to code a LISP Interpreter in Python.

The assignment specifications are included in the LISP_Pt2.pdf file in the root directory. Within the lisp_2 folder, my code submission can be found in the lab.py file.
